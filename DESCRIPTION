Description: Estimating the disparity between two groups based on the extended model of the Peters-Belson (PB) method. Our model is the first work on the longitudinal data, and also can set a varying variable to find the complicated association between other variables and the varying variable. Our work is an extension of the Peters-Belson method which was originally published in Peters (1941)<doi:10.1080/00220671.1941.10881036> and Belson (1956)<doi:10.2307/2985420>.
